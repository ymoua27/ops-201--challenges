Ops 201 Challenges

**What is this repo all about?**

A daily challenge to write a script to do something specific

**Why are you learning these skills?**

I am new to coding and tech, so a little taste of everything will help me understand it better

**What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?**

I learned that understanding how the shell works and different languages would be the fundamental concepts. Since they all work and do the same stuff with different commands, you have to understand that in order to get it to do what you want. 

**What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?**

The "hello world" challenge is my favorite since it was the first to introduce me to scripting

**How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?**

Using a shell is faster than using GUI in the workplace. On top of that, if you have automated scripts in hand already, it can increase the work productivity you need to do. 

**What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?**

Conditional scripts was interesting and I had a bit more difficulty with this one than other scripts. I particularly wanted to write the script to create directories within a directory, but was not successful and ending up making it on the desktop. 

**What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?**

I want to be able to just have more practice with writing scripts and how I can make it more efficient.
